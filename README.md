Sentimental analysis of reviews using RCNN algorithm
This project is about analysing the sentiments of people towards a specific object/person using RCNN algorithm.
RCNN is, simply, a combination of Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and Convulsional Neural Network.
RCNN is great at reading patterns, as well as reading sequential data, hence combining both CNN and RNN
The training accuracy is 95%, while the testing accuracy is above **92%**
